	  Driver for the Tegra graphics host hardware.

config TEGRA_DC

	depends on ARCH_TEGRA
	select FB_MODE_HELPERS
	select I2C
	help
	  Tegra display controller support.

config TEGRA_OVERLAY
	tristate "Tegra Overlay Device Node"
	depends on TEGRA_DC

	help
	  Device node for multi-client overlay support.

	  Framebuffer device support for the Tegra display controller.

config TEGRA_NVMAP
	bool "Tegra GPU memory management driver (nvmap)"
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to include the memory management driver for the Tegra
	  GPU, multimedia and display subsystems

config NVMAP_RECLAIM_UNPINNED_VM
	bool "Virtualize IOVMM memory in nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && TEGRA_IOVMM
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to enable nvmap to reclaim I/O virtual memory after
	  it has been unpinned, and re-use it for other handles. This can
	  allow a larger virtual I/O VM space than would normally be
	  supported by the hardware, at a slight cost in performance.

config NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM
	bool "Allow physical system memory to be used by nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here to allow nvmap to use physical system memory (i.e.,
	  shared with the operating system but not translated through
	  an IOVMM device) for allocations.

config NVMAP_HIGHMEM_ONLY
	bool "Use only HIGHMEM for nvmap"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP && (NVMAP_ALLOW_SYSMEM || TEGRA_IOVMM) && HIGHMEM
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to restrict nvmap system memory allocations (both
	  physical system memory and IOVMM) to just HIGHMEM pages.

config NVMAP_CARVEOUT_KILLER
	bool "Reclaim nvmap carveout by killing processes"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to allow the system to reclaim carveout space by killing
	  processes. This will kill the largest consumers of lowest priority
	  first.

config NVMAP_CARVEOUT_COMPACTOR
	bool "Compact carveout when it gets fragmented"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default y
	help
	  When carveout allocation attempt fails, compactor defragements
	  heap and retries the failed allocation.
	  Say Y here to let nvmap to keep carveout fragmentation under control.

config NVMAP_SEARCH_GLOBAL_HANDLES
	bool "Check global handle list when generating memory IDs"
	depends on TEGRA_NVMAP
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to allow the system to search through memory handles not
	  owned by the caller when generating a memory ID.  This shouldn't be
	  necessary for well-written applications, but is provided for
	  compatibility with legacy applications.
	  If unsure, say N.

config TEGRA_ENABLE_SUPPORT_FOR_1080p_30HZ
	bool "Enable support for 1080p @ 30Hz"
	default n
	help
	  Say Y here to Enable 1080p@30Hz instead of 1080p@60Hz 
	  If unsure, say N.
